## Background

Mach 42 is a research-driven trading technology firm, founded in 2019 to tackle the lack of automated trading infrastructure at the PSX. Led by Murtaza Tunio, a UC Berkeley Physics graduate with experience in experimental research and quantitative trading, we specialize in developing quantitative trading strategies, and building end-to-end trading systems to support them. Our expertise spans trading signal generation, order management systems (OMS), risk management systems (RMS), and FIX Layer  order execution.



## What We Do

We are building a next-generation trading system for institutional traders. It is designed from the ground up for high-performance execution, real-time portfolio monitoring, and intelligent order handling. We are also building an ecosystem of quantitative trading algorithms which run on this system.

Our current focus is robust system development, rigorous sandbox testing, and reliable algorithm design. Our infrastructure is built to evolve into a full-scale, algorithmic trading and execution platform. In the future, alongside trading our proprietary strategies, we aim to offer execution services that optimize liquidity, enhance order flow, and improve price discovery.

Our algorithms will be designed to:
- **Enhance market liquidity** through optimized slicing and timing of orders, executing block trades efficiently while minimizing information leakage.
- **Provide execution solutions** that help optimize order flow during periods of volatility around events such as earnings releases.
- **Simplify market-making** for designated and proprietary liquidity providers. Enabling tighter spreads, better quotes, reduced slippage while optimizing capital efficiency and inventory management.
- **Implement real-time portfolio risk management** to dynamically hedge positions and balance portfolios.


Emerging markets present a unique set of challenges: regulatory constraints, low liquidity and volumes, outdated infrastructure, no crossing networks. Our approach is designed to operate effectively within these limitations while optimizing execution and market participation.

The next phase for Mach 42 involves refining and validating our algorithms, stress-testing our systems in live market conditions, creating strategic partnerships and obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals to expand our capabilities.

Our vision is to transform trading in emerging markets by integrating cutting-edge quantitative research with robust infrastructure. Through rigorous research, continuous iteration, and responsible deployment we ensure that our systems and strategies are not only profitable but also contribute positively to the market as a whole, from institutions to retail investors.
