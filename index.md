## Background

Mach 42 is a research-driven trading technology firm, founded in 2019 to tackle the lack of automated trading infrastructure at PSX. Led by Murtaza Tunio, a UC Berkeley Physics graduate with experience in experimental research and quantitative trading, we specialize in building end-to-end trading systems. Our expertise spans trading signal generation, order management systems (OMS), risk management systems (RMS), and FIX Layer execution.



## What We Do

We are developing a next-generation quantitative trading platform—designed from the ground up for high-performance execution, real-time portfolio monitoring, and intelligent order handling. Our current focus is rigorous system development, sandbox testing, and algorithm design. While we are not yet live trading, our infrastructure is built to evolve into a full-scale, algorithmic trading and execution platform. In the future, we aim to offer execution services that optimize liquidity, enhance order flow, and improve price discovery, alongside trading our proprietary strategies.



## Where We're Heading

Our long-term vision is to transform how trading is conducted in emerging markets by integrating cutting-edge quantitative research with a robust trading infrastructure. The next phase for Mach 42 involves refining and validating our algorithms, stress-testing our systems in live market conditions, and obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals to expand our capabilities.

Once live, our algorithms will be designed to:

- **Enhance market liquidity** by efficiently executing large orders while minimizing impact.
- **Provide execution solutions** that help institutions and brokers optimize their order flow.
- **Develop market-making strategies** that contribute to tighter spreads, higher liquidity, and better price discovery.
- **Implement real-time portfolio risk management** to dynamically hedge positions.

We believe that algorithmic trading is not just about speed—it’s about intelligence, adaptability, and market structure improvements. By continuously testing, iterating, and validating our approach, we aim to build a trading ecosystem that benefits all market participants, from institutions to retail investors.

_It's not a question of if, but when..._

Our commitment is to deploy our own capital in a controlled and responsible manner, ensuring that our systems and strategies are not only profitable but also contribute positively to the market. Through rigorous research, thoughtful execution, and long-term dedication, we are paving the way for a more efficient, transparent, and sophisticated trading landscape in developing markets.
